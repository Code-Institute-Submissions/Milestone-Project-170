                <p>King John's Castle is a 13th-century castle located on King's Island in Limerick, next to the River Shannon. The foundation of the city of Limerick, however, is generally dated to 922, when the Viking leader Thormodu Helgason established a permanent base on King's Island, this is the area where King John's Castle now stands. It is located at the heart of Limerick’s medieval quarter. The site on which the Castle stands has been occupied for over 1000 years.

                <p>Saint Mary’s Cathedral was founded in 1168 AD and stands majestically over the City of Limerick on the banks of the River Shannon. It is one of the most important medieval buildings to survive intact in Ireland, which is still performing its original function. It is the oldest building in Limerick still in continuous daily use. It is an extraordinary building that has been ever-present during invasions, sieges, battles, wars, famines and times of peace.

                <p>The Treaty Stone is a monument with a stone said to be used in the signing of the 1691 Treaty of Limerick, marking the surrender of the city to William of Orange. It has rested on a plinth since 1865, at the Clare end of Thomond Bridge. The Treaty Stone stands across the River Shannon from King John's Castle. Tradition has it the Treaty of Limerick, that ended the Williamite-Jacobite War, was signed on this limestone block, in Limerick City.

                <p>Sarsfield Bridge is a five-span limestone road bridge. It was built between 1824-35 connecting Sarsfield Street and Ennis Road. It was once a swivel bridge that could open allowing large vessels to pass into the upper quays. This function is no longer in use although the mechanisms can still be seen under the bridge. The foundation stone was laid on the 25th October 1824 and the bridge was opened 5th August 1835, with a cost of £89,061. The design of the bridge is based on Pont Neuilly in Paris. Each span reaches 70 feet, with each arch rising to a height of 8 feet 6 inches.
