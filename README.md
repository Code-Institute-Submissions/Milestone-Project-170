# Discover Limerick
 
## Interactive Front-End Development

### Milestone Project 2
---

> **Discover Limerick** is an interactive front-end development website promoting the magnificent city of Limerick in the south-west of Ireland. The website concentrates on three main areas - Attractions, Activities and Coffee. I have chosen to display 8 attractions, 8 activities and 8 coffee shops in and around Limerick City using Google Maps to help users identify and locate their desired destination. 

> Every month, 1 attraction, 1 activity and 1 coffee shop will be featured as part of 'Our Monthly Favourites' initiative. These selections will be promoted and recommended more favourably than the others. 

> The website has a home page showcasing selected attractions, activities and coffee shops. The home page will contain a full-width Google Map displaying the 24 selected locations which the website is promoting. It will also display current, up-to-date weather conditions for Limerick City, including the actual temperature and the feels like temperature. There are a total of 4 tabs excluding the home page. There are tabs for Attractions, Activities, Coffee and About. The About tab will display interesting facts and stories about Limerick City.

## UX

The website was designed to promote the best attractions, activities and coffee spots Limerick has to offer. This project was undertaken with a deep passion for Limerick City. It was created with three main objectives in mind:  <br>

- To encourage locals to explore and connect with their city <br>
- To encourage people living outside of Limerick to visit the city <br>
- To encourage people of all ages to be more active and spend more time outdoors

As mentioned, the website focuses on three main areas - Attractions, Activities and Coffee. <br>
**Attractions:** is a list of our top 8 selected sights or attractions. The most popular attraction promoted on the main homepage is King John's Castle. This sight was selected as the first attraction as part of 'Our Monthly Favourites' initiative. It will be promoted more favourably than the other attractions for the month. King John's Castle is a 13th-century castle located on King's Island in Limerick, next to the River Shannon. This is a family- friendly list with attractions for all ages. <br>

**Activities:** is a list of our top 8 selected activities or adventures. The centrepiece activity being on display is Cratloe Woods, a forested area with plenty of hiking and biking trails to explore. This list includes activities for all ages but also attracts the more adventurous kind. This place was selected as the first activity as part of 'Our Monthly Favourites' initiative. It will be promoted more favourably than the other attractions for the month. <br>

**Coffee:** is a list of our top 8 selected coffee shops. The flagship coffee shop selected was Hook & Ladder Sarsfield Street as the first attraction as part of 'Our Monthly Favourites' initiative. It will be promoted more favourably than the other coffee shops for the month. Hook & Ladder have four cafés located in Limerick. <br>

All destinations have been marked on Google Maps displayed on the main page allowing users to identify and locate their desired destinations on the map. 


### User Stories

> 1. I am a user who lives in Limerick but there is a large part of the city I have not yet explored or visited. I feel there are so many sights to see and things to do, it can be difficult to decide on one. I am unsure which places are worth visiting in my free time.
> 2. I am a user who lives outside of Limerick but would love to learn more about the city before visiting. I like to plan my trips precisely in order to visit as many locations as possible during my stay in the city. For this reason, I like to strategically organised my time and route to achieve this goal.
> 3. I am a user who lives in Limerick City and made a resolution to become more active this year. I need a little motivation to get outside more often and to increase my step count. I love learning about the city I grew up in and I would like to achieve that while being on the move. 

### Design

-   #### Colour Scheme
    
The colour scheme chosen for this website is pretty simplistic. The three colours used throughout the site are White (#FFFFFF), Nobel (#A0A0A0) and LightSeaGreen(#20B2AA). The use of White and Nobel gives the website a sleek, striking look. I chose the LightSeaGreen colour because it is representative of County Limerick and the jerseys worn by GAA inter-county players in the past. Another reason I chose LightSeaGreen is because it is symbolic of the many key waterways that the city of Limerick was built on. 

-   #### Typography
    
The primary font used for the text on this website is Source® Sans Pro. Source® Sans Pro was Adobe's first open source typeface family and was designed by Paul D. Hunt. It is a sans serif typeface intended to work well in user interfaces. I chose this font because it is easy to read.

The headings on this website use the Big Shoulders font type. Big Shoulders is a superfamily of condensed American Gothic typefaces, created for the Chicago Design System, as well as the citizens of Chicago. The family's tall, sans-serif forms are based in Chicago's multiple histories in railway transport, public political action, and dance. It is great font for headings because it is attractive to the eye.

Another font used is Quicksand. Quicksand is a display sans serif with rounded terminals. It is designed for display purposes but kept legible enough to use in small sizes as well.

-   #### Imagery 

Imagery is vital for grabbing the attention and interest if the user. The large, background cover image was chosen to catch the user's attention. It also symbolises the dramatic local history of this renowned city.

## Scope

People living in Limerick and people visiting for a short trip have so many attractions and activities to choose from. There are a multitude of things to see and do in and around Limerick City. For this reason, we have selected the top locations to explore while visiting the city. This website narrows down the scope of locations into three tidy lists.

Limerick is a compact city which many sights to see and things to do, mostly within walking distance of one another. The demographic we are targeting is not limited to just adventurers but also families with kids of all ages. The website is intuitive and user-friendly presenting information about the best Limerick City has to offer.

The home page will display current, up-to-date weather conditions for Limerick City, including the actual temperature and the feels like temperature. This will allow users to organise and coordinate their plans more effectively to make the most of the ever-changing weather conditions. 

Every month, 1 attraction, 1 activity and 1 coffee shop will be featured as part of 'Our Monthly Favourites' initiative. These selections will be promoted and recommended more favourably than the others. The selections will be updated from one month to the next to allow other less popular sights to be highlighted and promoted.

Each of the three tabs (Attractions, Activities & Coffee) display recommended places that the user may like. It will display three places at a time before shuffling and refreshing the selections every 15 seconds.

The final tab is the entitled About. This is include interesting bits of information and stories about the history of Limerick.

<a name="testing"></a>

## Testing

- The website underwent testing routinely and regularly throughout the initial build. I found [Chrome DevTools] (https://developers.google.com/web/tools/chrome-devtools) to be extremely useful in the creating of this project. Chrome DevTools is a set of web developer tools built directly into the Google Chrome browser. DevTools can help you edit pages on-the-fly and diagnose problems quickly, which ultimately helps you build better websites, faster.

- I also found the Responsive Viewer Chrome Extension to be very useful in testing multiple screen sizes simultaneously. Responsive Viewer is a Chrome extension to show multiple screens in one view. the extension will help front-end developers to test multiple screens while developing responsive websites and applications.

I validated all HTML pages using the Markup Validator (https://validator.w3.org/#validate_by_input). The Markup Validator is a free service by W3C that helps check the validity of Web documents.

I validated all CSS pages using the Markup Validator (https://jigsaw.w3.org/css-validator/#validate_by_input). The W3C CSS Validation Service is a free software created by the W3C to help Web designers and Web developers check Cascading Style Sheets (CSS).

- I reviewed all the selected locations in my Google Maps API individually to ensure all the ID's and markers were all working smoothly and were showing up in the correct locations.

## Bugs

- I experienced an issue with the Open Weather API feature. 
- I had an issue with the Accordion jumping to the top of the page every time I clicked on it. I was able to resolved this by add this detail to each < a > tag.

> `<a href="javascript:void(0);"></a>`

- The images did not display when I deployed the website at first. I quickly realised the images didn't use an absolute file path. I corrected this by adding absolute file paths instead of relative file paths.

<a name="deployment"></a>

## Deployment

I used [GitHub Pages](https://pages.github.com/) to deploy my interactive front-end website. GitHub Pages is a static site hosting service that takes HTML, CSS, and JavaScript files straight from a repository on GitHub, optionally runs the files through a build process, and publishes a website.

The steps I followed to deploy the website on GitHub Pages were as follows:
<ol>
<li>Open my repository on GitHub</li>
<li>Click on 'Settings'</li>
<li>Scroll down as far as GitHub Pages</li>
<li></li>
<li>Select 'Branch: master' and click 'Save'</li>
<li>GitHub Pages will notify you that 'Your site is ready to be published at...'</li>
<li>Refresh the page</li>
<li>GitHub Pages will now notify you that 'Your site is published at...'</li>
<li>Click on the link included in the notification</li>
<li>The website will open</li>
</ol>
