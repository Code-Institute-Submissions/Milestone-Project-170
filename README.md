# Discover Limerick
 
## Interactive Front-End Development

### Milestone Project 2
---

> **Discover Limerick** is an interactive front-end development website promoting the magnificent city of Limerick in the south-west of Ireland. The website concentrates on three main areas - Attractions, Activities and Coffee. I have chosen to display 8 attractions, 8 activities and 8 coffee shops in and around Limerick City using Google Maps to help users find their desired destination. Every month, 1 attraction, 1 activity and 1 coffee shop will be featured as part of 'Our Monthly Favourites'. These selections will be promoted and recommended more favourably than the others.

## UX

The website was designed to promote the best attractions, activities and coffee spots Limerick has to offer. This project was undertaken with a deep passion for Limerick Cit. It was created with three main objectives in mind:  <br>

- To encourage locals to explore and connect with their city <br>
- To encourage people living outside of Limerick to visit the city <br>
- To encourage people of all ages to be more active and spend more time outdoors

As mentioned, the website focuses on three main areas - Attractions, Activities and Coffee. <br>
**Attractions:** is a list of our top 8 selected sights or attractions. The largest attraction promoted on the main homepage is King John's Castle. King John's Castle is a 13th-century castle located on King's Island in Limerick, next to the River Shannon. This is a family- friendly list with attractions for all ages. <br>

**Activities:** is a list of our top 8 selected activities or adventures. The centrepiece activity being on display is Cratloe Woods, a forested area with plenty of hiking and biking trails to explore. This list includes activities for all ages but also attracts the more adventurous kind. <br>

**Coffee:** is a list of our top 8 selected coffee shops. The flagship coffee shop is Hook & Ladder Sarsfield Street. Hook & Ladder have four cafés located in Limerick. <br>
All destinations have been marked on Google Maps displayed on the main page to allow users to seamlessly navigate from one destination to the next.


### User Stories

> 1. I am a user who lives in Limerick but there is a large part of the city I have not yet explore or visited. I feel there is so many sights to see and things to do, it can be difficult to decide on one. I am unsure which places are worth visiting in my free time.
> 2. I am a user who lives outside of Limerick but would love to learn more about the city before visiting. I like to plan my trips precisely in order to visit as many locations as possible during my stay in the city. For this reason, I like to strategically organised my time and route to achieve this goal.
> 3. I am a user who lives in Limerick City and made a resolution to become more active this year. I need a little motivation to get outside more often and to increase my step count. I love learning about the city I grew up in and I would like to achieve that while being on the move.
