                <p>Cratloe Woods is a forested area around the village of Cratloe outside of Limerick City. Much of the original oak forest has been replaced with coniferous softwoods during the past century; however, small pockets of native oak survive. There are several walking and hiking routes to explore. It is believed that the beams of the roof in Westminster Hall came originally from the Cratloe Wood. Cratloe Wood, in County Clare, gets its name from the Irish for land of the Sally trees. Beside the small village of Cratloe are the Cratloe forests, which were originally primeval oak woods.
